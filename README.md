# Introduction

Card Generator - a simple tool allows a user to generate a number of cards containing randomized alphabet letters.

# Logic

1. The page should load initially with two inputs fields — one for number of cards and another for number of rows/columns — and a button to generate the cards.
2. The maximum number allowed for both inputs should be 5. An error should be presented on submit if the input is invalid.
3. The “generate” button should be disabled if either of these fields is 0 or empty.
4. Each card should consist of randomized, unique capital letters, with no letters repeating on a single card.
5. The card should be implemented as a SFC (single-file component) with a property for the number of rows/columns.
6. The number of cards generated and the number of rows/columns in each card should reflect the user input.
7. Letters in the card should be horizontally and vertically centered within their spaces.
